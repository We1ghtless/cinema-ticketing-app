Cinema Tickets Exercise
Congratulations on reaching this stage of our application process and thank you for taking part
in this assessment exercise.
A cinema requires a new ticketing system to be used in their new app. There are two
types of ticket:
● Standard: £7.90
● Concession: £5.40
In addition, there are a few extras which can be added to some tickets:
● Real3D: £0.90
● IMAX: £1.50
The Cinema also wants to have special offers that are applied automatically. A specific offer
they would like to include from the start is:
● Three for One Thursdays (buy one get two free for tickets purchased on Thursdays)

Ticket Totaling

Your task is to implement a checkout system that can calculate the total cost of any combination
of tickets that a user might buy using the app. Please bear in mind:
● Tickets can be added in any order
● Offers should always be applied if possible
● The cinema owner would like to be able to show the customer how much they saved
when offers have been applied
● New types of pricing/offers may need to be added in the future
Please think carefully about each aspect of the problem and define a solution that fits the
requirements listed. Answers should be written in Javascript (preferably Typescript) and can
make use (or not) of any frameworks as desired. A complete solution to the problem is not
required and a UI is not expected.
Please note any assumptions you make and what you would do differently in a production
system.
As a guide this test should take approximately 3 hours, it is designed to be challenging and
there are lots of ways to approach it. It’s ok to spend more time on it but we don’t want to take
up an excessive amount of your time. If you don’t have time to complete everything you’d like to,
feel free to submit a partial solution with a summary of how you’d tackle the outstanding
aspects. It won’t count against you, we’re aware that varying circumstances can make finding
time for recruitment exercises tricky.
